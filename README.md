# Breast Cancer Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. The project utilizes a machine learning model trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection and classification of breast tumors are crucial for effective treatment planning and patient outcomes. In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast tumors as malignant or benign based on various features extracted from diagnostic images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mragpavank/breast-cancer) available on Kaggle. It consists of diagnostic features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image. This dataset contains a total of 569 instances with 30 features each.

## Installation
